,,DTR_Underrun,read-write,[3],"Data transmit register/FIFO underrun.
This bit is set at the end of a SPI element transfer by a one-clock period strobe to the interrupt register when data is requested from an empty transmit register/FIFO by the SPI core logic to perform a SPI transfer.
This can occur only when the SPI device is configured as a slave in standard SPI configuration and is enabled by the SPE bit as set. All zeros are loaded in the shift register and transmitted by the slave in an under-run condition
"
,,DRR_Full,read-write,[4],"Data receive register/FIFO full.
Without FIFOs, this bit is set at the end of a SPI element transfer by a one-clock period strobe to the interrupt register (An element can be a byte, half-word, or word depending on the value of Transfer Width).
With FIFOs, this bit is set at the end of the SPI element transfer, when the receive FIFO has been completely filled by a one-clock period strobe to the interrupt register.
"
,,DRR_Overrun,read-write,[5],"Data receive register/FIFO overrun.
This bit is set by a one-clock period strobe to the interrupt register when an attempt to write data to a full receive register or FIFO is made by the SPI core logic to complete a SPI transfer.
This can occur when the SPI device is in either master or slave mode (in standard SPI mode) or if the IP is configured in SPI master mode (dual or quad SPI mode).
"
,,TXFIFO_Half_Empty,read-write,[6],"Transmit FIFO half empty.
In standard SPI configuration, IPISR Bit[6] is the transmit FIFO half-empty interrupt. 
In dual or quad SPI configuration, based on the FIFO depth, this bit is set at half-empty condition.
Note: This interrupt exists only if the AXI Quad SPI core is configured with FIFOs (In standard, dual or quad SPI mode).
"
,,Slave_Select_Mode,read-write,[7],"Slave select mode.
The assertion of this bit is applicable only when the core is configured in slave mode in standard SPI configuration. 
This bit is set when the other SPI master core selects the core by asserting the slave select line. This bit is set by a one-clock period strobe to the interrupt register.
Note: This bit is applicable only in standard SPI slave mode
"
,,DRR_Not_Empty,read-write,[8],"DRR not empty.
The assertion of this bit is applicable only in the case where FIFO Depth is 16 or 256 and the core is configured in slave mode and standard SPI mode. This bit is set when the DRR FIFO receives the first data value during the SPI transaction.
This bit is set by a one-clock period strobe to the interrupt register when the core receives the first data beat.
Note: The assertion of this bit is applicable only when the FIFO Depth parameter is 16 or 256 and the core is configured in slave mode in standard SPI mode. When FIFO Depth is set to 0, this bit always returns 0. This bit has no significance in dual/quad mode
"
,,CPOL_CPHA_Error,read-write,[9],"CPOL_CPHA error.
This flag is asserted when:
  The core is configured in either dual or quad SPI mode and
  The CPOL - CPHA control register bits are set to 01 or 10.
In standard SPI mode, this bit is always in default state.
"
,,Slave_Mode_Error,read-write,[10],"I/O mode instruction error.
This flag is asserted when:
  The core is configured in either dual or quad SPI mode and
  The core is configured in master = 0 in control register (SPICR(2)).
In standard SPI mode, this bit is always in default state.
"
,,MSB_Error,read-write,[11],"MSB error.
This flag is asserted when:
  The core is configured in either dual or quad SPI mode and
  The LSB First bit in the control register (SPICR) is set to 1.
In standard SPI mode, this bit is always in default state.
"
,,Loopback_Error,read-write,[12],"Loopback error.
This flag is asserted when:
  The core is configured in dual or quad SPI transfer mode and
  The LOOP bit is set in control register (SPICR(0)).
In standard SPI mode, this bit is always in default state.
"
,,Command_Error,read-write,[13],"Command error.
This flag is asserted when:   The core is configured in dual/quad SPI mode and   The first entry in the SPI DTR FIFO (after reset) does not match with the supported command list for particular memory. When the SPI command in DTR FIFO does not match with the internal supported command list, the core completes the SPI transactions in standard SPI format. This bit is set to show this behavior of the core.
In standard SPI mode this bit is always in default state.

,,Slave_Select_Mode,read-write,[7],"Slave_Select_Mode.   0 - Disabled.   1 - Enabled. This bit is applicable only when the core is configured in slave mode by selecting the active-Low status on spisel.

"
,,DRR_Not_Empty,read-write,[8],"DRR_Not_Empty.   0 - Disabled.   1 - Enabled. Note: The setting of this bit is applicable only when FIFO Depth is set to 1 and the core is configured in slave mode of standard SPI mode.
If FIFO Depth is set to 0, the setting of this bit has no effect. This is allowed only in standard SPI configuration. It means this bit is not set in the IPIER register. Therefore, this bit should only be used when FIFO Depth is set to 1 and when the core is configured in slave mode.
This bit has no significance in dual or quad mode.
